# 100-Days-of-Python

This repositary will include all the project I did from this Udemy course called "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023".
I want to use this chance to also learn how to write a good documentation so I'll also do my best constanly update the README. If you have some good reference material might be helpful or suggestions on how to make my documentation better, please create an issue for this repository so I can improve upon my documentation skill. Thanks in advance!

I also included all the topics that this course covered in the bottom for reference:

## Day 1 - Band Name Generator

- Printing
- Debugging
